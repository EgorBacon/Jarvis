This is the Repo for my OpenCV facial recognition iron-man themed project

I am very much a beginner when it comes to python, and most of my code was just research so this isn't a polished project.

TODO:
1. Fix basic error
2. Make a deep learned library
3. Add face learning on the go functionality
4. Add Raspi Zero

This is for Gleb

Usage
My code also looks at the folder names of images so:
1. In folder images make a folder for each person you have photos of (e.g will-smith)
2. run faces-train.py
3. run face-detect.py (Doesn't work has error and face recognition is very bad)

This is a just an ongoing project for me so...this doesn't work. However if you have any tips, please explain more because I am keen to learn more about this.

Will post on this repo when it will.
